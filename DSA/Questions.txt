# How would you determine if there is a cycle in a linked list? 

# How would you find the head of the cycle i.e. where the cycle starts?

# How would you find the kth element from the end of a linked list?

# Given a linked list with three fields: a data field, a next field and a random pointer field
(which is a field that points to null or to an element in the linked list) write a function to return
a copy of the linked list without destructively modifying the original linked list  

# find value in pivoted, sorted array

# all sum combinations in list
